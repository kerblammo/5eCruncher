This is an encounter calculator for Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition. It's designed to be quick and easy to use, and is suited for DMs that do not particularly care what monsters exactly are going to be used.

Simply add how many party members you have and how many monsters they fight, and it'll do quick math for you.
